Recently, I was reading through [A/B Testing with Machine Learning - A Step-by-Step Tutorial](https://www.business-science.io/business/2019/03/11/ab-testing-machine-learning.html) written by [Matt Dancho](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattdancho/) of [Business Science](https://www.business-science.io). I have been always fascinated by the idea of **A/B Testing** and the amount of impact it can bring in businesses. The tutorial is very definitive and Matt has explained each and every step in the tutorial. He has detailed about each and every decision taken while developing the solution. 

Even though the tutorial is written in `R`, I was able to scram through his code and my knowledge of Data Science helped me to understand the concepts very quickly. I will have to thank Matt for putting together all the key ingredients of the Data Science world and or using them to solve a real problem.  

The notebook in this repository contains my implementation of the solution (presented by Matt) in Python.
